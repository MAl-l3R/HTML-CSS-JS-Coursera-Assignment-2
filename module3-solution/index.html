        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
        incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
        establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and
        nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
        social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
        existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[19] When a rooster finds food, he may call other
        chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
        the food. This behavior may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them
        to eat. Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
